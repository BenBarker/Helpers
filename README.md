# Helpers
Small helper scripts and tools

* cleanKdenliveProject.py - command line tool to remove unused files from disk based on a text file generated in Kdenlive, an open source video editing tool.

* motionDetectMoveMouse.py - Move the mouse based on input from webcam. If motion is detected the mouse is moved.
This is to switch scenes in OBS (screen recording and streaming software) based on camera activity.
OBS supports automatic switching based on mouse activity, but not camera activity. This hacks around that.
